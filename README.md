# Monopoly

Hello Web-Dev Community,

In this JS- Final Projekt i tryed to build a Monopolyboard to get some first interactions between you and my code.
You don´t need to install anything just Roll the dice, build some house and win or lose your Money.

In this Project i worked with:

HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Please feel free to get in contact for some nice words or any Tippś i can use to work on it in future.
